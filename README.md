# Winamax-real-time-push-or-fold
push/fold poker bot for winamax

STEP 1: Build the java files (both together otherwise it won't work)
SETP 2: Install tesseract on your PC.
STEP 3: Change the different paths in the python file according to your own hand history path and tesseract installation path
STEP 4: Replace the nickname in the python file, put your own.

The bot will just show you an optimal range, it won't play for you. Make sure to play with full window mode and do not put your mouse cursor on top of the window otherwise the bot won't be able to read the tourney number.

PS: Create the path: pokerai/game/icm at root and place the java files in icm folder.
